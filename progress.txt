Dashboard Wiring Implementation

Task: Wire src/pages/Dashboard.tsx: replace hardcoded stats with useClips/useJobs hooks, pass real data to RecentClips and ProcessingQueue

Changes Made:

1. Created useClips Hook (src/hooks/useClips.ts)
   - Implemented useClips hook following the same pattern as useJobs
   - Added support for filtering by status, limit, offset
   - Optional polling for real-time updates when clips are processing
   - Methods: refresh, updateClip, deleteClip, bulkDelete, bulkExport
   - Created useClip hook for fetching single clips
   - Exported from src/hooks/index.ts

2. Updated Dashboard.tsx (src/pages/Dashboard.tsx)
   - Imported and used useClips hook with limit of 10 clips
   - Imported and used useJobs hook to fetch all jobs and processing jobs
   - Replaced hardcoded stats with real data calculations:
     * Total Clips: Shows count of loaded clips
     * Processing: Shows count of active jobs (not completed/failed)
     * Best Performer: Shows highest HYDE score from clips
     * Clips Today: Filters clips created today
   - Passed real data to RecentClips and ProcessingQueue components
   - Added loading states for better UX

3. Updated RecentClips Component (src/components/dashboard/RecentClips.tsx)
   - Added props interface to accept clips array and loading state
   - Removed hardcoded placeholder data
   - Display real clip data: title, status, duration, HYDE score
   - Show thumbnail if available
   - Format duration as MM:SS
   - Format HYDE score as percentage
   - Display appropriate messages for loading and empty states
   - Limit display to first 4 clips

4. Updated ProcessingQueue Component (src/components/dashboard/ProcessingQueue.tsx)
   - Added props interface to accept jobs array and loading state
   - Removed hardcoded placeholder data
   - Display real job data: title, status, progress, clips found
   - Filter to show only active jobs (not completed/failed)
   - Show status text for each job stage
   - Display clip count when clips are found
   - Display appropriate messages for loading and empty states
   - Limit display to first 3 active jobs

Implementation Details:
- All components now use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Loading states prevent premature rendering
- Empty states provide clear user feedback
- Real-time polling enabled for processing jobs (5s interval)
- Dashboard calculates stats dynamically from fetched data
- Components handle edge cases (no data, loading, errors)

Testing Recommendations:
- Test with empty database (no clips/jobs)
- Test with processing jobs to verify polling works
- Test with completed clips to verify stats calculations
- Verify loading states display correctly
- Check that HYDE scores display as percentages
- Verify job progress bars update in real-time
