Created src/components/clips/ClipCard.tsx

## Summary
Implemented a reusable ClipCard component for displaying video clips with the following features:

### Features Implemented
1. **Thumbnail Display**: Shows clip thumbnail or placeholder icon if not available
2. **Title**: Displays clip title with line-clamp for long titles
3. **Duration Badge**: Shows formatted duration (MM:SS) in bottom-right corner
4. **Status Badge**: Dynamic status indicator with icons and colors for:
   - Processing (blue, with spinning loader)
   - Ready (green, with checkmark)
   - Exported (forge red/orange, with checkmark)
   - Failed (red, with alert icon)
5. **HYDE Score Badge**: Displayed for high-scoring clips (≥70)
6. **Action Buttons**: Configurable buttons for:
   - Edit (always available)
   - Download (only for 'ready' clips)
   - Share (only for 'ready' clips)
   - Delete (with red hover state)
7. **Play Overlay**: Hover-activated play button for ready clips
8. **Metadata Row**: Shows HYDE score and available signals (chat velocity, audio peaks)

### Technical Details
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Uses existing Clip interface from src/lib/api.ts
- Follows project styling patterns (Tailwind CSS, dark theme)
- Uses lucide-react icons
- Responsive design with hover states
- Accessibility labels on all interactive elements
- Optional callback props for flexibility

### Notes
- Test framework not yet configured in the project, so tests were skipped
- Component is ready to use and follows all existing patterns in the codebase
