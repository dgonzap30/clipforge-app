## Slim down src/store/index.ts

Successfully removed Clip and QueueItem types and server state arrays from src/store/index.ts.

Changes made:
- Removed Clip interface (lines 5-22)
- Removed QueueItem interface (lines 24-34)
- Removed clips array from AppState
- Removed queue array from AppState
- Removed clip-related actions: addClip, updateClip, removeClip
- Removed queue-related actions: addToQueue, updateQueueItem, removeFromQueue
- Kept Settings type and UI-only state (user object)
- Kept only setUser and updateSettings actions

The store now contains only:
- Settings type with detection and output configuration
