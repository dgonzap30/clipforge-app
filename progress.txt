## ProtectedRoute Component Implementation

### What was implemented:
- Created `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` with the following features:
  - Uses `useAuth` hook to check authentication status
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to `/connect` page
  - Shows loading spinner while checking authentication
  - Renders children (protected content) only when authenticated
  - Uses React Router's `navigate` with `replace: true` to prevent back button issues

### Implementation details:
- **Authentication check**: Leverages existing `useAuth` hook from `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- **Backend integration**: Works with existing Twitch OAuth backend (not Supabase Auth)
- **Loading state**: Displays a centered loading spinner with "Checking authentication..." message
- **Redirect behavior**: Uses `useEffect` to redirect when auth state changes
- **Styling**: Matches existing app design system (forge colors, dark theme)

### Testing:
- No test framework is currently set up in the project (no vitest/jest configuration found)
- Tests would require setting up vitest + @testing-library/react + react-router mocks
- Component is ready for manual testing once integrated into routing

### Next steps:
- Component is ready to be used in `src/App.tsx` to wrap protected routes
- Works with existing authentication infrastructure (Twitch OAuth via backend API)
