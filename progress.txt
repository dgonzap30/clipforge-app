## Task: Wire src/pages/Queue.tsx

### Completed:

1. **Created VodBrowserModal component** (src/components/queue/VodBrowserModal.tsx)
   - Implemented modal with channel search functionality
   - Integrated with api.vods.getByChannel to fetch VODs
   - Displays VOD list with thumbnails, titles, durations, and view counts
   - Allows users to select a VOD to add to processing queue
   - Includes loading and error states
   - Supports external links to original VODs

2. **Wired Queue.tsx with useJobs hook**
   - Replaced mockQueue array with useJobs hook from @/hooks/useJobs
   - Added loading and error states for job fetching
   - Jobs now display real data from the API
   - Automatic polling enabled for active jobs (5-second interval)

3. **Wired cancel/retry/delete actions**
   - Cancel: Works for processing jobs (downloading, analyzing, extracting, reframing, captioning)
   - Retry: Available for failed jobs to restart processing
   - Delete: Available for all jobs with confirmation dialog
   - All actions show loading spinner while executing
   - Error handling with user-friendly error messages

4. **Added VodBrowserModal to Add Stream button**
   - Both "Add Stream" header button and empty state button open the modal
   - Modal allows searching Twitch channels and browsing their VODs
   - Selecting a VOD creates a new job via useJobs.createJob
   - Job creation includes vodId, vodUrl, title, channelLogin, and duration

### Technical Details:

- Queue page now displays real job statuses with proper status badges
- Progress bars show for processing jobs with percentage and clips found count
- Different action buttons based on job status (cancel for processing, retry for failed)
- Duration formatting helper converts seconds to HH:MM:SS format
- Status display mapping for user-friendly status labels
- Empty state prompts users to add their first stream
- Loading state shows spinner while fetching initial jobs

### Testing:

No test framework is currently configured in the project (no vitest, jest, or testing-library).
Skipped test creation as tests would require setting up testing infrastructure first.
