Task: Update server/src/index.ts - import and start BullMQ worker, add graceful shutdown handler, read CORS origins from env var

Completed:

1. Created server/src/queue/connection.ts
   - Redis connection factory for BullMQ
   - Singleton pattern with getRedisConnection() and closeRedisConnection()
   - Configured with maxRetriesPerRequest: null for BullMQ compatibility
   - Added error and connection event handlers

2. Created server/src/queue/processingQueue.ts
   - BullMQ Queue instance named 'vod-processing'
   - Uses Redis connection from connection.ts
   - Configured with retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
   - Job retention settings (100 completed, 500 failed)
   - ProcessingJobData interface with jobId field

3. Created server/src/queue/worker.ts
   - BullMQ Worker for processing VOD jobs
   - Concurrency set to 1 (processes one job at a time)
   - Event handlers for ready, active, completed, failed, and error events
   - stopWorker() function for graceful shutdown
   - Placeholder for runPipeline integration (to be added when orchestrator is implemented)

4. Updated server/src/index.ts
   - Imported worker and stopWorker from ./queue/worker
   - Imported closeRedisConnection from ./queue/connection
   - Added CORS_ORIGINS environment variable parsing (comma-separated list)
   - Falls back to default origins if CORS_ORIGINS is not set
   - Added gracefulShutdown() function that:
     * Stops the BullMQ worker
     * Closes Redis connection
     * Exits process cleanly
   - Registered SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers for graceful shutdown

5. Updated server/.env.example
   - Added CORS_ORIGINS configuration with example values
   - Documented as comma-separated list of allowed origins

Implementation details:
- Worker automatically starts when index.ts is imported
- CORS origins default to http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:5173 if not configured
- Graceful shutdown ensures no jobs are interrupted and connections are properly closed
- All queue infrastructure files are properly typed with TypeScript
