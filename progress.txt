Created docker-compose.yml at project root with:
- API service built from server/Dockerfile
- Redis service (redis:7-alpine)
- Environment variable pass-through for Supabase, OpenAI, and app config
- Health checks for both services
- Named volumes for Redis data persistence and temp file processing
- Bridge network for service communication
- Proper service dependencies (API waits for Redis to be healthy)

Also created:
- server/Dockerfile: Multi-stage build with Bun runtime, FFmpeg, and yt-dlp
- .env.example: Template file documenting required environment variables

The docker-compose setup allows running the entire backend stack with:
  docker-compose up -d
