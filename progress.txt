# Task: Wire src/pages/Settings.tsx - Make form controlled via Zustand

## Completed
- Converted all form inputs from uncontrolled (defaultValue/defaultChecked) to controlled components
- Imported useStore and Settings type from store
- Added local form state using useState to track form changes
- Implemented updateFormData helper to properly update nested settings
- Connected all form fields to local state:
  - Detection settings: minDuration, maxDuration, sensitivity
  - Detection toggles: chatAnalysis, audioPeaks, faceReactions
  - Output settings: defaultFormat, autoCaptions, captionStyle
- Implemented handleSave function that calls updateSettings from Zustand store
- Connected Save button to handleSave handler
- Zustand persist middleware automatically handles localStorage persistence
- Verified build passes with no TypeScript errors

## Technical Details
- Form uses controlled components with value/checked props
- Local state allows editing without immediate persistence
- Save button triggers persistence to both Zustand store and localStorage (via persist middleware)
- All settings maintain proper TypeScript types from store/index.ts
