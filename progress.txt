## Task: Create server/src/pipeline/stages/analyze.ts

### Completed
- Created `server/src/pipeline/stages/` directory structure
- Implemented `analyze.ts` with full audio processing pipeline:
  - `analyze()` function that orchestrates the audio analysis workflow
  - Calls `extractAudio()` to extract audio from video file
  - Calls `getAudioLevels()` to analyze audio amplitude data
  - Calls `analyzeAudioLevels()` to detect audio moments (peaks, sustained, silence breaks)
  - Calls `fuseSignals()` with configured weights: {chat: 0, audio: 0.8, clips: 0.2}
  - Returns both raw audio moments and fused signal moments
  - Added convenience function `analyzeWithDefaultWeights()` for default configuration
- Created comprehensive test suite in `analyze.test.ts`:
  - 9 passing tests covering all functionality
  - Tests for audio extraction pipeline
  - Tests for signal fusion with custom/default weights
  - Tests for handling chat moments and viewer clips
  - All tests use proper mocking with Bun's spyOn

### Implementation Details
- Used TypeScript with proper types imported from audio.ts and fusion.ts
- Configured default weights as specified: chat=0, audio=0.8, clips=0.2
- Added flexibility for custom weights and audio output paths
- Followed existing codebase patterns and conventions
