Removed hardcoded 'Free Plan' footer section from src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx

Changes made:
- Removed the footer section containing the hardcoded "Free Plan" text and "3 clips remaining" counter
- Simplified the Sidebar component by removing lines 56-62 which contained the footer div with border and plan information
- The navigation now takes up the full height of the sidebar with flex-1 class
