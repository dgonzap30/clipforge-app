Created server/Dockerfile with multi-stage build:
- Stage 1 (deps): Installs production dependencies with Bun
- Stage 2 (builder): Installs all dependencies and performs TypeScript type checking
- Stage 3 (runtime): Final image with Bun runtime, FFmpeg, and yt-dlp
  - Uses Alpine-based Bun image for minimal footprint
  - Installs FFmpeg via apk
  - Installs yt-dlp via pip3
  - Runs as non-root user (nodejs:1001) for security
  - Exposes port 8787
  - Includes health check endpoint
  - Optimized with multi-stage build to keep final image small

Also created server/.dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files from Docker context.

Key features:
- Multi-stage build reduces final image size
- Type checking in build stage catches errors before runtime
- Security: runs as non-root user
- Health checks for container orchestration
- Production-ready with only necessary dependencies in final image
