### Completed Tasks:

1. **Enhanced User Store** (src/store/index.ts)
   - Added displayName, login, avatarUrl, and email fields to user state
   - Updated default state to include new fields

2. **Updated useAuth Hook** (src/hooks/useAuth.ts)
   - Modified checkAuth() to populate user profile data from API response
   - Updated logout() to clear all user fields including new profile fields
   - Now extracts display_name, login, profile_image_url, and email from Twitch API response

3. **Implemented Header Component** (src/components/layout/Header.tsx)
   - Integrated useAuth hook to access user authentication state
   - Display user avatar (from Twitch profile_image_url) or fallback gradient avatar
   - Display user's display name with fallback to login or "User"
   - Added dropdown menu functionality with click-outside-to-close behavior
   - Implemented logout action in dropdown menu
   - Shows "Connect Twitch" button when user is not authenticated
   - Added loading state handling for auth operations
