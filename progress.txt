# Agent 14 Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx
- Handles OAuth redirect callbacks for both cookie-based and Supabase Auth flows
- Shows loading spinner during authentication processing
- Displays error messages if authentication fails
- Redirects to dashboard on success or connect page on failure

### 2. Created src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx
- Wrapper component that checks authentication status using useAuth hook
- Shows loading spinner while checking auth status
- Redirects unauthenticated users to /connect page
- Renders children components for authenticated users

### 3. Updated src/App.tsx
- Added import for AuthCallback component
- Added import for ProtectedRoute component
- Added new route: /auth/callback for handling OAuth callbacks
- Wrapped the Layout route (and all nested routes) with ProtectedRoute component
- This protects all authenticated routes: /, /clips, /queue, /settings

## Summary
Successfully implemented authentication routing with protected routes. The app now:
- Has a dedicated OAuth callback handler at /auth/callback
- Protects all main application routes (dashboard, clips, queue, settings)
- Redirects unauthenticated users to the connect page
- Shows appropriate loading states during authentication checks
