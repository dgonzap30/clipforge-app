## Task: Add @tanstack/react-query to frontend package.json, wrap app in QueryClientProvider in src/main.tsx

### Changes Made:

1. **package.json**:
   - Added @tanstack/react-query version ^5.62.0 to dependencies

2. **src/main.tsx**:
   - Imported QueryClient and QueryClientProvider from @tanstack/react-query
   - Created a new QueryClient instance
   - Wrapped the app in QueryClientProvider, passing the queryClient as the client prop
   - Provider hierarchy is now: StrictMode > QueryClientProvider > BrowserRouter > App

### Result:
The application is now set up with TanStack Query (React Query) for efficient server state management. The QueryClientProvider makes the query client available to all components in the app tree.
