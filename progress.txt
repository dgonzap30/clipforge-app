## Task: Wire ProcessingQueue component to accept jobs prop

### Changes Made:
1. Updated ProcessingQueue.tsx to accept jobs array as a prop instead of using hardcoded data
   - Added ProcessingQueueProps interface with jobs: ProcessingJob[] property
   - Imported ProcessingJob type from @/lib/api
   - Replaced hardcoded processingItems array with jobs prop
   - Updated component to render from jobs prop (mapping over jobs instead of processingItems)
   - Maintained all existing functionality including:
     - Loading spinner for jobs with progress > 0
     - Progress bar visualization
     - Empty state message when no jobs are present

### Files Modified:
- src/components/dashboard/ProcessingQueue.tsx

### Breaking Change:
- ProcessingQueue component now requires a `jobs` prop of type ProcessingJob[]
- Parent components (like Dashboard.tsx) will need to pass the jobs array to this component

### Next Steps:
- Parent component (Dashboard.tsx) will need to be updated to fetch jobs and pass them as prop
- This enables the component to display real processing job data instead of mock data
