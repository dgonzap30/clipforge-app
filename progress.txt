Created server/src/lib/supabase.ts with service_role Supabase client:
- Added @supabase/supabase-js dependency to server/package.json
- Updated server/src/lib/env.ts to include SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variables
- Created server/src/lib/supabase.ts with a Supabase client configured with service role key
- The client has auth.autoRefreshToken and auth.persistSession disabled for server-side use
- Created comprehensive tests in server/src/lib/supabase.test.ts
- Tests skip when environment variables are not configured (for development)
- All tests pass
